our project is mainly devided into two modules one is to convert text to speech and other to detect object and find its postion and let user know as audiofeedback.

create a new folder named yolo-coco in yolo master and place coco.cfg and coco.names in it.
also download weight file from link provided in mark up readme  and place it in yolo-coco folder.

also download ffmpeg using follwong instrution in video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_KqycyErd8  and add ffmpeg to your enviornment variable as mentioned in video 

Each of the module has to be created into an executable file which can be run .Before creating any such files ensure that python files executes without any error. 

exe files can be created using Pyinstaller 
you can download it using pip install Pyinstaller
Create exe files by opening cmd in same directory as yolo master running below two commands
pyinstaller --onefile real-time-audio.py
pyinstaller --onefile text.py


object detection can be run using real-time-audio.exes

text to speech can be done using text.exe

By default it reads image screenshot.jpeg with in the same directory . For custom text to speech output you can either put a custom screenshot.jpg or open text.py and remove comments 

from - 

#camera = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

#return_value, image = camera.read()
#cv2.imwrite('screenshot'+'.jpg', image)
#del(camera)

present at 11, 13,14,15 lines respectively then it would take image from your computer web-cam if found any text would convert it into audio.
